# command-orchestrator
Simple Linux Command Orchestrator Design to Learn the concept

# How to Build
Go to each directory and do make

[rrout@RASHMI-PC /vol/command-orchestrator/action-handler (master=)]

$make

[rrout@RASHMI-PC /vol/command-orchestrator/orchestrator (master=)]

$make

# How to test
Open 2 Terminal and execute the process

**START EXECUTION SERVER**

[rrout@RASHMI-PC /vol/command-orchestrator/action-handler (master=)]

$./action-handler

**START ORCHISTRATOR**

[rrout@RASHMI-PC /vol/command-orchestrator/orchestrator (master=)]

$./orchestrator

**Note**, "action-handler" is the execution server/micro service where "orchestrator" connects, So you MUST
start "action-handler"  prior to "orchestrator" ("orchestrator" will fail is it cant connect to execution server)

**Display Status**
Open Another Terminal and telnet to "orchestrator" which is running at port 9000

[rrout@RASHMI-PC /vol/command-orchestrator/orchestrator (master=)]

$ telnet localhost 9000
Trying 127.0.0.1...
